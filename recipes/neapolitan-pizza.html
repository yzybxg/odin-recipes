        <h2>Steps:</h2>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>In a bowl, combine lukewarm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
                    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture.</li>
                    <li>Mix until it comes together, then knead on a floured surface for about 10 minutes or until the dough is smooth and elastic.</li>
                    <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise for 1-2 hours or until doubled in size.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Sauce:</strong>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>In a bowl, crush the San Marzano tomatoes by hand, and add salt and olive oil. Mix gently.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat it to the highest temperature (usually around 500-550°F or 260-288°C) for at least 30 minutes.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Shape the Dough:</strong>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Divide the risen dough into two equal portions. On a floured surface, gently stretch and shape each portion into a round pizza crust.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Assemble the Pizza:</strong>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Place each stretched dough on a piece of parchment paper.</li>
                    <li>Spread a thin layer of the tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a border around the edges.</li>
                    <li>Add slices of fresh mozzarella and scatter fresh basil leaves on top.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Bake the Pizza:</strong>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Carefully transfer the parchment paper with the assembled pizza onto the preheated pizza stone in the oven.</li>
                    <li>Bake for 8-10 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong>
